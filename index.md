## A bit about me

I am graduating from Montclair State University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May 2018.
I also have three years of phone and desktop support experience with MSU's IT Service Desk.
I'm passionate about projects that help creators (musicians, artists, YouTube/filmmakers,etc.), push boundaries and help resolve social issues.

### What's going on right now?

I'm looking into blockchain at the moment.
This includes web development for blockchain and ethereum and learning to program with Solidity.
Unity3D and more front-end development are next on the list.

### Some of my repositories

[An e-commerce store with a relational database](https://github.com/rachel-w/Bobs-Music-Store)

This was part of a group project for a Databases course. We also made an ER diagram.


[Sortable Array Lists](https://github.com/rachel-w/sortable-array-lists)

From a data structures and algorithms class. 
The goal was to implement the stack ADT and sort the array lists with different sorting algorithms.


[My first blog](https://github.com/rachel-w/my-first-blog)

The product of using the Django Girls tutorial to learn more about front-end web development and Django

[Blockchain Web Development](https://github.com/rachel-w/blockchainWeb)

Based on Vlad Wulf's "Blockchain Developer Essentials" YouTube tutorials.
A simple page that pulls an address from TestRPC blockchain when clicking the "Contact Server" button. I wanted to dip my toes in web development for blockchain. I stumbled upon this tutorial when looking for videos on Solidity.

[YouTube Scrapers](https://github.com/rachel-w/YouTubeCategorize)

From a project where I wanted to predict the likelihood of a YouTube video being demonetized.
It pulled the data through YouTube's API (Python wrapper) and wrote it to a CSV file.
I initially ran this through AzureML to pick the best algorithm, but I would like to use Python NLP to analyze this data.
This is a data-science-heavy project, and very unfamiliar to me, but I enjoyed the process of working on an issue I cared about.
The project would ideally help YouTube creators understand what kind of content loses it's ability to collect ad revenue.
Understanding this would help them determine what kind of video to make or how much time to spend on it.
